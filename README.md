# 🛡️ Phishing Link Detector

This is a simple JavaScript-based project I built to detect potentially dangerous or phishing links. The goal was to create a lightweight tool that can quickly scan a URL and give users a warning if the link looks suspicious.

---

## 💡 Why I Made This

With phishing attacks becoming more common, I wanted to explore how URL structures can help us identify unsafe websites. This project helped me understand the basic patterns behind phishing links and how we can write rules to catch them.

## 🔍 What It Does

- Lets you paste a URL and checks it for common phishing patterns
- Detects things like:
  - Use of IP addresses instead of domain names
  - Too many subdomains
  - Suspicious keywords (like "login", "verify", etc.)
  - Long or weird-looking URLs
- Gives a simple warning message if something seems off

---

## 🛠️ Tech Used

- HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
- No backend – everything runs in the browser
- Fully responsive design

---

## 🚀 What I Learned

- How phishing links are crafted
- Writing rule-based detectors using JS
- DOM manipulation and user interaction handling
- Basics of responsive UI and error handling
